# Project Name: Game Genre

## Project Description: This was a project where I had to go online and find a dataset to analyze.
I used Juypyter Notebook to do analyze the data. I used pandas to organize and study the data, using numpy 
and statistics to create arrays and make statisical analysis, analyze the data by making correlations and counting values, 
and matplotlib to make graphs and charts of the data.

## Project Tasks
  **Task 1: Install all the proper programs**
  - Install Juypter Notebook, pandas and matplotlib installed on your computer.
  **Task 2: Find a dataset**
  - If you go on google you can find hundreds of datasets. I would suggest going to Kaggle since 
    they have tons of datasets making your search not only faster but easiern (make sure it's a 
    CSV file). 
  **Task 3:Import and make the dataset readable for Juypter Notebook**
  - Import pandas 
  - Use pandas to import the CSV file into Juypter Notebook
  - Then use pandas to make the dataset into a data frame. 
  **Task 4 make arrays and statistical analysis**
  - Import Numpy and Statisics.
  - Make arrays with Numpy and use Statistics to find the average.
  - Use the .corr function to find correlations between 
  - Use the value_count() function to count the values of the different columns
  - Import Matplotlib and make graphs. 

## Project Skills Learned
  - Analyzing data using Jupyter Notebook
  - Using Pandas to create data frames
  - Using Numpy and Statistics to analyze data
  - Using Matplotlib to create graphs

## Languages Used
  - **Juypter Notebook**: to store and analyze data

## Notes
  - When finding data make sure you find one that has enough information to do data on
